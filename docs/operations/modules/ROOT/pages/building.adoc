= Building
:page-aliases: reference::building.adoc

`build` is a module within the XTDB repo with two key objectives:

* Providing pre-configured JARs and Docker containers to start a basic implementation of XTDB with no prior knowledge required.
* Providing a mechanism to spin up custom XTDB artifacts - with two necessary inputs:
** A `deps.edn` file containing the dependencies that the node requires.
** A `xtdb.edn` file, containing the configuration options to start the node with.

== Preconfigured Artifacts

=== `xtdb-in-memory`

The `xtdb-in-memory` artifact starts up a basic, in-memory XTDB node, with both a HTTP Server _(open on port 3000)_ and the xref:sql.adoc[XTDB SQL] module with a SQL server _(open on port 1501)_.

It can be downloaded:

* as a Docker image from https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/juxt/xtdb-in-memory[JUXT's Docker Hub]
* as an uberjar, `xtdb-in-memory.jar`, from the relevant https://github.com/xtdb/xtdb/releases[GitHub release]

Communication with the node is done via the XTDB REST API - see the xref:http.adoc[HTTP docs] for more information.

== Building Artifacts

Alongside the JARs deployed on the GitHub releases is `xtdb-builder.tar.gz` - the scripts within this archive can be used to build a custom XTDB JAR or Docker container.

=== Building a JAR (Clojure CLI tooling)

The `clj-uberjar` folder contains a number of files:

* a `deps.edn` file to configure the Maven dependencies required
* a `xtdb.edn` file to configure the node itself
* a `resources/logback.xml` to configure logging output
* a `build-uberjar.sh` script to build the JAR.

To use `rocksdb` as the index store, document store and transaction-log store of the node:

* Add `xtdb-rocksdb` as a dependency in `deps.edn`:
+
[source,clojure, subs=attributes+]
----
...
com.xtdb/xtdb-rocksdb {:mvn/version "{xtdb_version}"}
...
----
* In `xtdb.edn`, override the old topology with the following:
+
[source,clojure]
----
{:xtdb/index-store {:kv-store {:xtdb/module xtdb.rocksdb/->kv-store, :db-dir "/tmp/xtdb/indexes"}}
 :xtdb/document-store {:kv-store {:xtdb/module xtdb.rocksdb/->kv-store, :db-dir "/tmp/xtdb/documents"}}
 :xtdb/tx-log {:kv-store {:xtdb/module xtdb.rocksdb/->kv-store, :db-dir "/tmp/xt/tx-log"}}
 :xtdb.http-server/server {}}
----

To build the JAR, run the `build-uberjar.sh` script.
You can optionally pass the environment variable `UBERJAR_NAME` to the script (for example, `UBERJAR_NAME=xtdb-rocks.jar ./build-uberjar.sh`), otherwise the built uberjar will be called `xtdb.jar`.
To run the clojure uberjar, use the following command `java -jar xtdb.jar`. This will now start up a node with both a HTTP server and persistent storage.

=== Building a JAR (Maven tooling)

Similarly to building a JAR using the Clojure CLI tooling, we can also build an uberjar using Maven.
In the `mvn-uberjar` directory, add dependencies to the `pom.xml` file, update the `xtdb.edn` file as before, and then run `build-uberjar.sh` to create the uberjar. To run the maven generated uberjar, use the following command: `java -jar xtdb.jar`

=== Building a Docker Container

In the `docker` directory, there are a similar set of files to the uberjar examples above, as well as a `Dockerfile` and a `build-docker.sh` script.

As with building a JAR, to add `rocksdb` as the KV store - start by adding a dependency on `xtdb-rocksdb` within `deps.edn`.

Override the topology within `xtdb.edn` with the following:

[source,clojure]
----
{:xtdb/index-store {:kv-store {:xtdb/module xtdb.rocksdb/->kv-store, :db-dir "/var/lib/xtdb/indexes"}}
 :xtdb/document-store {:kv-store {:xtdb/module xtdb.rocksdb/->kv-store, :db-dir "/var/lib/xtdb/documents"}}
 :xtdb/tx-log {:kv-store {:xtdb/module xtdb.rocksdb/->kv-store, :db-dir "/var/lib/xt/tx-log"}}
 :xtdb.http-server/server {}}
----

To build your Docker container, run the `build-docker.sh` script.
You can optionally pass the environment variables `IMAGE_NAME` and `IMAGE_VERSION` to tag the container with (by default, the custom Docker container is called `xtdb-custom:latest`).
