[#overview]
== Overview

XTDB is optimised for efficient and globally consistent point-in-time queries
using a pair of `transaction-time` and `valid-time` timestamps.

Ad-hoc systems for bitemporal recordkeeping typically rely on explicitly
tracking either `valid-from` and `valid-to` timestamps or range types directly
within relations.  The bitemporal document model that XTDB provides is very
simple to reason about and it is universal across the entire database,
therefore it does not require you to consider which historical information is
worth storing in special "bitemporal tables" upfront.

One or more documents may be inserted into XTDB via a `put` transaction at a
specific `valid-time`, defaulting to the `transaction time` (i.e. `now`), and
each document remains valid until explicitly updated with a new version via
`put` or deleted via `delete`.

[#why]
== Why?

The rationale for bitemporality is also explained in this
https://juxt.pro/blog/posts/value-of-bitemporality.html[blog post].

A baseline notion of time that is always available is
`transaction-time`; the point at which data is transacted into the
database.

Bitemporality is the addition of another time-axis: `valid-time`.

.Time Axes
[#table-conversion%header,cols="d,d"]
|===
|Time|Purpose
|`transaction-time`|Used for audit purposes, technical requirements such as event sourcing.
|`valid-time`|Used for querying data across time, historical analysis.
|===

`transaction-time` represents the point at which data arrives into the
database. This gives us an audit trail and we can see what the state
of the database was at a particular point in time. You cannot write a
new transaction with a `transaction-time` that is in the past.

*valid-time* is an arbitrary time that can originate from an upstream
 system, or by default is set to transaction-time. Valid time is
 what users will typically use for query purposes.

****
Writes can be made in the past of valid-time as _retroactive operations_. Users
will normally ask _"what is the value of this entity at valid-time?"_
regardless if this history has been rewritten several times at multiple
transaction-times. Writes can also be made in the future of valid-time as
_proactive operations_.

Typically you only need to consider using both transaction-time and valid-time
for ensuring globally consistent reads across nodes or to query for audit
reasons.
****

NOTE: In XTDB, when `transaction-time` isn't specified, it is set to
_now_. When writing data, in case there isn’t any specific valid-time
available, valid-time and transaction-time take the same value.

[#valid]
== Valid Time

In situations where your database is not the ultimate owner of the data—where
corrections to data can flow in from various sources and at various times—use
of *transaction-time* is inappropriate for historical queries.

Imagine you have a financial trading system and you want to perform
calculations based on the official 'end of day', that occurs each day at 17:00
hours. Does all the data arrive into your database at exactly 17:00? Or does
the data arrive from an upstream source where we have to allow for data to
arrive out of order, and where some might always arrive after 17:00?

This can often be the case with high throughput systems where there
are clusters of processing nodes, enriching the data before it gets to
our store.

In this example, we want our queries to include the straggling bits of
data for our calculation purposes, and this is where *valid-time*
comes in. When data arrives into our database, it can come with an
arbitrary time-stamp that we can use for querying purposes.

We can tolerate data arriving out of order, as we're not completely
dependent on transaction-time.

****
In a ecosystem of many systems, where one cannot control
the ultimate time line, or other systems abilities to write into the
past, one needs bitemporality to ensure evolving but consistent views
of the data.
****

[#transaction]
== Transaction Time

For audit reasons, we might wish to know with certainty the value of a
given entity-attribute at a given `tx-instant`. In this case, we want to
exclude the possibility of the valid past being amended, so we need a
pre-correction view of the data, relying on `tx-instant`.

To achieve this you can use `as-of` using `ts` (`valid-time`) and `tx-ts`
(`transaction-time`).

****
Only if you want to ensure consistent reads across nodes or to query
for audit reasons, would you want to consider using both
transaction-time and valid-time.
****

[#domain]
== Domain Time

Valid time is valuable for tracking a consistent view of the entire state of
the database, however, unless you explicitly include a timestamp or other
temporal component within your documents you cannot currently use this
information about valid time inside of your Datalog queries.

Domain time or "user-defined" time is simply the storing of any additional
time-related information within your documents, for instance `valid-time`,
`duration` or timestamps relating to additional temporal life-cycles (e.g.
decision, receipt, notification, availability).

Queries that use domain times do not automatically benefit from any
kind of native indexes to support efficient execution, however XTDB
encourages you to build additional layers of functionality to do
so. See https://github.com/crux-labs/crux-decorators[decorators] for
examples.

[#uses]
== Known Uses

Recording bitemporal information with your data is essential when dealing with
lag, corrections, and efficient auditability:

- Lag is found wherever there is risk of non-trivial delay until an event can
  be recorded. This is common between systems that communicate over unreliable
networks.
- Corrections are needed as errors are uncovered and as facts are reconciled.
- Ad-hoc auditing is an otherwise intensive and slow process requiring
  significant operational complexity.

With XTDB you retain visibility of all historical changes whilst compensating
for lag, making corrections, and performing audit queries. By default, deleting
data only erases visibility of that data from the current perspective. You may
of course still evict data completely as the legal status of information
changes.

These capabilities are known to be useful for:

- Event Sourcing (e.g.
  https://fr.slideshare.net/ThomasPierrain/as-time-goes-by-episode-2[retroactive
and scheduled events] and https://oparu.uni-ulm.de/xmlui/bitstream/handle/123456789/4150/RetroactiveComputing_Mueller2016.pdf?sequence=5&isAllowed=y[event-driven computing on evolving graphs])
- Ingesting out-of-order temporal data from upstream timestamping systems
- Maintaining a slowly changing dimension for decision support applications
- Recovering from accidental data changes and application errors (e.g. billing
  systems)
- Auditing all data changes and performing data forensics when necessary
- Responding to new compliance regulations and audit requirements
- Avoiding the need to set up additional databases for historical data and
  improving end-to-end data governance
- Building historical models that factor in all historical data (e.g. insurance
  calculations)
- Accounting and financial calculations (e.g payroll systems)
- Development, simulation and testing
- Live migrations from legacy systems using ad-hoc batches of backfilled
  temporal data
- Scheduling and previewing future states (e.g. publishing and content
  management)
- Reconciling temporal data across eventually consistent systems

Applied industry-specific examples include:

- Legal Documentation – maintain visibility of all critical dates relating to
  legal documents, including what laws were known to be applicable at the time,
and any subsequent laws that may be relevant and applied retrospectively
- Insurance Coverage – assess the level of coverage for a beneficiary across
  the lifecycle of care and legislation changes
- Reconstruction of Trades – readily comply with evolving financial regulations
- Adverse Events in Healthcare – accurately record a patient’s records over
  time and mitigate human error
- Intelligence Gathering – build an accurate model of currently known
  information to aid predictions and understanding of motives across time
- Criminal Investigations – efficiently organise analysis and evidence whilst
  enabling a simple retracing of investigative efforts

****

During a criminal investigation it is critical to be able to refine a temporal
understanding of past events as new evidence is brought to light, errors in
documentation are accounted for, and speculation is corroborated. The paper
referenced above gives the following query example:

****
Find all persons who are known to be present in the United States on day 2
(valid time), as of day 3 (transaction time)
****

The paper then lists a sequence of entry and departure events at various United
States border checkpoints. We as the investigator will step through this
sequence to monitor a set of suspects. These events will arrive in an
undetermined chronological order based on how and when each checkpoint is able
to manually relay the information.

==== Day 0

Assuming Day 0 for the investigation period is `#inst "2018-12-31"`, the
initial documents are ingested using the Day 0 valid time:
[source,clj]
----
include::example$test/xtdb/docs/examples/bitemporality_test.clj[tags=bitemp0,indent=0]

include::example$test/xtdb/docs/examples/bitemporality_test.clj[tags=bitemp1,indent=0]
----

The first document shows that `Person 2` was recorded entering via `:SFO` and
the second document shows that `Person 3` was recorded entering `:LA`.

==== Day 1

No new recorded events arrive on Day 1 (`#inst "2019-01-01"`), so there are no
documents available to ingest.

==== Day 2

A single event arrives on Day 2 showing `Person 4` arriving at `:NY`:
[source,clj]
----
include::example$test/xtdb/docs/examples/bitemporality_test.clj[tags=bitemp2,indent=0]
----

==== Day 3

Next, we learn on Day 3 that `Person 4` departed from `:NY`, which is
represented as an update to the existing document using the Day 3 valid time:
[source,clj]
----
include::example$test/xtdb/docs/examples/bitemporality_test.clj[tags=bitemp3,indent=0]
----

==== Day 4

On Day 4 we begin to receive events relating to the previous days of the
investigation.

First we receive an event showing that `Person 1` entered `:NY` on Day 0 which
must ingest using the Day 0 valid time `#inst "2018-12-31"`:
[source,clj]
----
include::example$test/xtdb/docs/examples/bitemporality_test.clj[tags=bitemp4,indent=0]
----

We then receive an event showing that `Person 1` departed from `:NY` on Day 3,
so again we ingest this document using the corresponding Day 3 valid time:
[source,clj]
----
include::example$test/xtdb/docs/examples/bitemporality_test.clj[tags=bitemp4b,indent=0]
----

Finally, we receive two events relating to Day 4, which can be ingested using
the current valid time:
[source,clj]
----
include::example$test/xtdb/docs/examples/bitemporality_test.clj[tags=bitemp4c,indent=0]

include::example$test/xtdb/docs/examples/bitemporality_test.clj[tags=bitemp4d,indent=0]
----

==== Day 5

On Day 5 there is an event showing that `Person 2`, having arrived on Day 0
(which we already knew), departed from `:SFO` on Day 5.
[source,clj]
----
include::example$test/xtdb/docs/examples/bitemporality_test.clj[tags=bitemp5,indent=0]
----

==== Day 6

No new recorded events arrive on Day 6 (`#inst "2019-01-06"`), so there are no
documents available to ingest.

==== Day 7

On Day 7 two documents arrive. The first document corrects the previous
assertion that `Person 3` departed on Day 4, which was misrecorded due to human
error. The second document shows that `Person 3` has only just departed on Day
7, which is how the previous error was noticed.

include::example$test/xtdb/docs/examples/bitemporality_test.clj[tags=bitemp7b,indent=0]
----

==== Day 8

Two documents have been received relating to new arrivals on Day 8. Note that
`Person 3` has arrived back in the country again.

[source,clj]
----
include::example$test/xtdb/docs/examples/bitemporality_test.clj[tags=bitemp8a,indent=0]

include::example$test/xtdb/docs/examples/bitemporality_test.clj[tags=bitemp8b,indent=0]
----

==== Day 9

On Day 9 we learn that `Person 3` also departed on Day 8.
[source,clj]
----
include::example$test/xtdb/docs/examples/bitemporality_test.clj[tags=bitemp9,indent=0]
----

==== Day 10

A single document arrives showing that `Person 5` entered at `:LA` earlier that
day.
[source,clj]
----
include::example$test/xtdb/docs/examples/bitemporality_test.clj[tags=bitemp10,indent=0]
----

==== Day 11

Similarly to the previous day, a single document arrives showing that `Person
7` entered at `:NY` earlier that day.
[source,clj]
----
include::example$test/xtdb/docs/examples/bitemporality_test.clj[tags=bitemp11,indent=0]
----

==== Day 12

Finally, on Day 12 we learn that `Person 6` entered at `:NY` that same day.
[source,clj]
----
include::example$test/xtdb/docs/examples/bitemporality_test.clj[tags=bitemp12,indent=0]
----

==== Question Time

Let's review the question we need to answer to aid our investigations:

****
Find all persons who are known to be present in the United States on day 2
(valid time), as of day 3 (transaction time)
****

We are able to easily express this as a query in XTDB:

[source,clj]
----
include::example$test/xtdb/docs/examples/bitemporality_test.clj[tags=bitempq-a,indent=0]
include::example$test/xtdb/docs/examples/bitemporality_test.clj[tags=bitempq-b,indent=12]
include::example$test/xtdb/docs/examples/bitemporality_test.clj[tags=bitempq-c,indent=2]
----

The answer given by XTDB is a simple set of the three relevant people along
with the details of their last entry and confirmation that none of them were
known to have yet departed at this point:

=== Retroactive Data Structures

At a theoretical level XTDB has similar properties to
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retroactive_data_structure[retroactive data
structures], which are data structures that support "efficient modifications to
a sequence of operations that have been performed on the structure [...]
modifications can take the form of retroactive insertion, deletion or updating
of an operation that was performed at some time in the past".

XTDB's bitemporal indexes are
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistent_data_structure#Partial_versus_Full_Persistence[partially
persistent] due to the immutability of transaction time. This allows you to
query any previous version, but only update the latest version. The efficient
representation of valid time in the indexes makes XTDB "fully retroactive",
which is analogous to partial persistence in the temporal dimension, and
enables globally-consistent reads.

XTDB does not natively implement "non-oblivious retroactivity" (i.e. persisted
queries and cascading corrections), although this is an important area of
investigation for https://github.com/vs-uulm/retro-lambda[event]
https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=3210284.3219499[sourcing]
https://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/RetroactiveEvent.html[applications],
https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3271883[temporal]
http://informatique.umons.ac.be/ssi/jef/tic.pdf[constraints], and reactive
bitemporal queries.

In summary, the XTDB indexes as a whole could be described as a "partially
persistent and fully retroactive data structure".
