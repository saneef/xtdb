= Transactions

Transactions are how you modify data within XTDB.

They are comprised of a series of Transaction Operations to be performed.

If the transaction contains pre-conditions, all pre-conditions must pass, or the
entire transaction is aborted. This happens at the query node during indexing,
and not when submitting the transaction.

Java::

A transaction is performed by calling `.submitTx` on an `IXtdbSubmitAPI` with a `Transaction` object.

The `Transaction` object can be created by either using `Transaction.Builder` directly or using a `Consumer`.

If using the `Consumer` approach, we recommend importing `xtdb.api.tx.Transaction.buildTx` statically for brevity.

[#operations]
== Operations

There are five transaction (write) operations:

.Write Operations
[cols="3,5,^2"]
|===
|Operation|Purpose|Pre-condition?

|<<#put, Put>>|Write a version of a document|
|<<#delete, Delete>>|Deletes a specific document|

|<<#evict, Evict>>|Evicts a document entirely, including all historical versions|
|<<#transaction-functions, Function>>|Runs a transaction function|✓

Java::
+
--
You can add individual operations to the `Transaction.Builder` instance with their respective methods.

Transaction Operations are vectors which have their associated keyword as their first value.

====

[#put]
=== Put

Puts a <<#document, Document>> into XTDB.
If a document already exists with the same `id`, a new version of this document will be created at the supplied `valid time`.
See <<valid-time, Valid Time>> for more details.

[#match]
=== Match

Match checks the state of an entity - if the entity doesn't match the provided document, the transaction will not continue.

Use the `hasTxCommitted` (`tx-committed?`) API to check whether the transaction was successfully committed or not due to a failed match operation.

Evict is primarily used for GDPR Right to Erasure compliance.

It is important to note that Evict is the only operation which will have effects on the results returned when querying against an earlier Transaction Time.

[#transaction-functions]
=== Transaction Functions

Transaction functions are user-supplied functions, defined using Clojure, that will run on each individual node where a transaction is being ingested and processed after having been read from the transaction log.
They are conceptually similar to "stored procedures" in traditional databases, except they can only return new transaction operations.

Transaction functions can be used, for example, to safely check the current database state before applying a transaction, for integrity checks, or to patch an entity.

[#transaction-functions-anatomy]
==== Anatomy
[source,clojure]
----
include::example$test/xtdb/docs/examples/transactions/transactions_test.clj[tags=fn-anatomy,indent=0]
----
<1> Transaction functions are passed a `context` parameter and any number of other parameters.
<2> The `context` parameter can be used to obtain a database value using `db` or `open-db`.
<3> Transaction functions should return a list of transaction operations or `false`

If a list of transaction operations is returned, these are indexed as part of the transaction.

If `false` is returned, or an exception is thrown, the whole transaction will roll back.

The `context` reflects the speculative accumulation of all transaction operations applied up to the current point in the processing.

==== Creating / Updating

Transaction functions are created/updated by submitting a document to XTDB with the desired function.

[tabs]
====
Java::
+
--
You create a function document with `XtdbDocument.createFunction`.

It takes the ID for the function as well as a string consisting of the Clojure function to run.

==== Usage

When invoking a transaction function, you specify its ID and (optionally) other arguments

Clojure::

Note that the transaction function operation `::xt/fn` is Clojure shorthand for `:xtdb.api/fn` (assuming the `xt` require alias is used) - be careful not to confuse this keyword with the `:xt/fn` keyword used inside the transaction function document.

Transaction functions may return further transaction function invocation operations, which will in turn expand recursively until there are only primitive transaction operations remaining for the given transaction.

[#document]
== Documents

[tabs]
====
Java::
+
--
A `XtdbDocument` is created with an ID that must be of a <<#valid-ids,valid type>>.

The instance itself is immutable and plusing/minusing data yields a new instance of `XtdbDocument`.

Similarly to Transactions, you can use `XtdbDocument.Builder` directly or use the `Consumer` approach.

A document is a map from keywords to values.

[source,clj]
----
{:xt/id :dbpedia.resource/Pablo-Picasso
 :name "Pablo"
 :last-name "Picasso"}
----

All documents must contain the `:xt/id` key.

Persistence of Clojure metadata is not supported (although is not currently rejected either) - we strongly recommended that all metadata should be removed from each document prior to submission to XTDB, to avoid potential equality checking issues (see https://github.com/xtdb/xtdb/issues/1510[here] for more details).
--
====

For operations containing documents, the id and the document are
hashed, and the operation and hash is submitted to the `tx-topic` in
the event log. The document itself is submitted to the `doc-topic`,
using its content hash as key. In Kafka, the `doc-topic` is compacted,
which enables later eviction of documents.

[#valid-ids]
=== Valid IDs

[tabs]
====
Java::
+
--
The following types of document IDs are allowed:

.Valid ID types (Java)
[cols="d,d"]
|===
|Type|Example

|Keyword|`Keyword.intern("my-id")`
|String|`"my-id"`
|Long|`42L`
|UUID|`UUID.randomUUID()`
|URI|`URI.create("mailto:hello@xtdb.com")`
|URL|`new URL("https://github.com/xtdb/xtdb")`
|IPersistentMap|`PersistentArrayMap.EMPTY.assoc("foo", "bar")`
|===
--

Clojure::
+
--
The following types of `:xt/id` are allowed:

.Valid ID types (Clojure)
[cols="d,d"]
|===
|Type|Example

|Keyword|`:my-id` or `:dbpedia.resource/Pablo-Picasso`
|String|`"my-id"`
|Integers/Longs|`42`
|UUID|`#uuid "6f0232d0-f3f9-4020-a75f-17b067f41203"`
|URI|`#xtdb/id "mailto:hello@xtdb.com"`
|URL|`#xtdb/id "https://github.com/xtdb/xtdb"`
|Maps|`{:this :id-field}`
|===

The `#xtdb/id` reader literal will take URI/URL strings and attempt to coerce them into valid IDs.

URIs and URLs are interpreted using Java classes (java.net.URI and java.net.URL respectively) and therefore you can also use these directly.

====

[#transaction-time]
== Transaction Time

When you submit a transaction, the current time will be the Transaction Time.

[#valid-times]
== Valid Times

When an optional `valid time` is omitted from a transaction operation, the Transaction Time will be used as `valid time`.

[#valid-time]
=== Only Valid Time Provided

When `valid time` is used as a parameter for Put or Delete, it specifies the time from which the change is valid.

If there is a document, `A`, already present at the given `valid time`, the operation's effect is valid from `valid time` to the end of the current validity of `A`.

[#end-valid-time]
=== End Valid Time

When both `valid time` and `end valid time` are provided for Put or Delete, the operation's effect is valid from `valid time` (inclusive) to `end valid time` (exclusive).

[#await]
== Awaiting Transactions

After a transaction is submitted, it needs to be indexed before it is visible in XTDB DB snapshots.

The return value from submitting the transaction can be used to wait for the transaction to be indexed.

This return value holds both the ID of the transaction, and the Transaction Time

[#speculative-transactions]
== Speculative transactions

You can submit speculative transactions to XTDB, to see what the results of your queries would be if a new transaction were to be applied.
This is particularly useful for forecasting/projections or further integrity checks, without persisting the changes or affecting other users of the database.

You'll receive a new database value, against which you can make queries and entity requests as you would any normal database value.
Only you will see the effect of these transactions - they're not submitted to the cluster, and they're not visible to any other database value in your application.

Java::

The entities submitted by the speculative Put take their valid time (if not explicitly specified) from the valid time of the `db` from which they were forked.

[#dropping-the-database]
== Dropping the database

XTDB does not currently provide any API to perform a "drop" operation (physical deletion) of the entire database. To drop the database, you must first manually `.stop` the node(s), then delete the underlying index-store directory, and then delete the relevant data (or directories) for the backend modules used for the transaction log and document store components.

For testing purposes you can use `Files/createTempDirectory` or equivalent.
